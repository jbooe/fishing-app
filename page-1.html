            <dl>
                <dt>Snook</dt>
                    <dd>
                    Snook often are found around structure, find the common bait fish located in the same area.  Typically
                    this will be Pilchards, Pinfish, Grunts, finger Mullet, and Ballyhoo.  Shrimp or a small crustation will also
                    work at times.  For artificals, use ones that best mimics the local bait fish. A soft paddle tail with a jig head 
                    is good bet.  A silver spoon also works well.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Redfish</dt>
                    <dd>
                    Redfish's favorite food are crustaceans, typically shrimp.  You can also catch them using local bait fish but this isn't 
                    always the case.  For artificals, use a Gulp or DOA shrimp on a jig head with a poping cork. A gold spoon also works well.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Sea Trout</dt>
                    <dd>
                    The Sea Trout will be caught using the same bait as the Snook or Redfish.  Because of the size difference,
                    the bait fish typically need to be smaller.  Also, you might want to use a weedless hook or a poping cork 
                    due to Sea Trout often are found in sea grass.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Tarpon</dt>
                    <dd>
                    Tarpon, also known as "Silver Kings", won't be as picky about food due to their incredible size. For them, it's all about
                    location.  If you see the Tarpon rolling on top of the water, your best bet is a bait fish under a cork.  If they are 
                    in the area, but are staying low, you will want to use a big chuck of cut bait on the bottom.  If a strong outgoing
                    tide is present, small crabs floting free in the water is your best bet. 
                    </dd>
                <dt>Grouper</dt>
                    <dd>
                    Grouper are found on bottom on or near structure.  The like both cutbait and live bait suck as Pinfish or
                    Sardines.  It's best practice to use cut bait first to get the bite going, then move to live bait.
                    </dd>
                <dt>Kingfish and Spanish Mackerel</dt>
                    <dd>
                    The Kingfish and Spanish Mackerel are closely related.  They both love "shinny" fast moving lures.  Use a silver
                    spoon or a varient.  They both also love a live baitfish.  Blue Runners and Ballyhoo typically work the best for Kingfish.  
                    Spanish Mackerel will take a wide range of baitfish. You will often find either of these fish around large schools of baitfish. 
                    </dd>
                <dt>Snapper</dt>
                    <dd>
                    Snapper are the most complex due to thier wide range of species.  All Snapper love live baitfish and cutbait alike.
                    The biggest difference between all of them is the depth in which you find them.  It is best practice to use chum to draw
                    in the fish.  Fish in or near the slick of the current taking the chum out.
